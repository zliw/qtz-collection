A collection of my quartz composer patches

## Wobble pattern

This is a pattern rendered in a Core Image Kernel is based on the square function of the pixel position, modified by a sinus function for x and y direction. The color is chosen by a color range. It can be used as a background patch with slow wave generators and a small color range or be used as a screensaver with faster animations.
